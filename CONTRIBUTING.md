## Reporting Bugs

Bug reports can be done with an issue, a pull request, or contacting us at support@bealore.com

If you're not running against the latest `main` branch version,
please compile and test against that to avoid re-reporting an issue that's
already been fixed.

It's _incredibly_ helpful to be able to reproduce the problem. Please
include a list of steps, a bit of code, and/or a zipped repository (if
possible). Note that some of the libgit2 developers are employees of
GitHub, so if your repository is private, find us on IRC and we'll figure
out a way to help you.
